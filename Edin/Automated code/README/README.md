Here I store automated code for the purpose of data analysis. As of right now, I only have one notebook automating the calculation of 
broadening functions (BF) using data from the Coude telescope at the McDonald observatory. Some of the data from the subsubgiants 
(SSGs) obtained by Ben Tofflemire were missing these BFs, hence the necessity to calculate them. It is vital to calculate these BFs in order 
for us to calculate the radial velocity and vsin(i) of these SSGs as we continue our work.

Some work still must be done to optimize the code, but it is more or less the final product. I will update it if I figure out a way to automate
the path input to each line in the .ls files.
