So, in this folder exists all the stars which I have made new .p files for. Be weary that the folder with the star's name had the original
.ls files, they end with ".ls-e" and edited .ls files which include the path to the directory in my computer

IDEALLY, just go into the star folder, there is a file called "Edin_p_files" and just download/copy those files.
